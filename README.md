## Description

You're losing a ton of money by being in a high-fee mutual fund. This app lifts the cover off the real cost of high-fee mutual funds and suggests alternatives that can literally save you millions in the long run.

## Background

We wanted to make a site that exposed how much people were jeapordizing their retirement by using a high-fee mutual fund. By implementing a clever UX and using some humor, we were able to convey how important it is to use a low-fee mutual fund.

## Features

* Automatic expense ratio scraping from morningstar.com
* Dynamic AJAX modal injection

## Usage

Simply input your details on [howmuchareyoupayingyourbroker.com](howmuchareyoupayingyourbroker.com) to get an idea of how much money you can save by switching to a low-fee mutual fund.

## Development/Contribution

We love pull requests! All we ask is that you submit RSpec tests along with any request.

## Future

What features are you currently working on? Only mention things that you
actually are implementing. No pie-in-the-sky-never-gonna-happen stuff.
