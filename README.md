## Background

We wanted to make a site that exposed how much people were jeapordizing their retirement by using a high-fee mutual fund. By implementing a clever UX and using some humor, we were able to convey how important it is to use a low-fee mutual fund.

## Features

* Automatic expense ratio scraping from morningstar.com
* Dynamic AJAX modal injection

## Usage

Simply input your details on [howmuchareyoupayingyourbroker.com](http://howmuchareyoupayingyourbroker.com) to get an idea of how much money you can save by switching to a low-fee mutual fund.

## Development/Contribution

We love pull requests! All we ask is that you submit RSpec tests along with any request.
